Lyle: I'm going to use this file as a central location to share what I'm currently doing,
 what my plan is for the immediate future, and most importantly, what files I am actively editing
 to help avoid merge conflicts. (Plus helps keep my brain from wandering all over the place)
 
 Symbol Table:
  Currently sticking what features i think will be needed for the project into the symbol table. 
  This probably will be a WIP over the course of the project. 
  
Active Files:
  All SymTab
