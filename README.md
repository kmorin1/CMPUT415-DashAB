Lyle: I'm going to use this file as a central location to share what I'm currently doing,
 what my plan is for the immediate future, and most importantly, what files I am actively editing
 to help avoid merge conflicts. (Plus helps keep my brain from wandering all over the place)
 
 Symbol Table:
	Currently sticking what features i think will be needed for the project into the symbol table. 
	This probably will be a WIP over the course of the project. 
 Type Handling:
	Currently working on getting the types of all expressions inserted into the symbol table, with proper promoted form
	will add error checking after this works. 
  
Active Files:
  All SymTab
  TypeExpand.g
